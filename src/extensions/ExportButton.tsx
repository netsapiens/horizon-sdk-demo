/**
 * Export action — contributed to `page-header-actions` on several pages.
 *
 * Declared, not rendered. The previous version of this file rendered its own
 * `<Button variant='text' sx={{ px: 1 }}>`, which is how an app ends up with a
 * header button that does not match the page it sits on: the house style for a
 * secondary action (`variant="soft" color="neutral"`) was something the app had
 * to know and restate, and the raw MUI variants stayed reachable.
 *
 * Here the app states only what the button *is* — a secondary action — and the
 * host renders it exactly as it renders its own. There is no variant to get
 * wrong and no `sx` to drift.
 *
 * Page data still reaches the handler: `onClick` receives the same `pageContext`
 * the component path received, so the export can act on the user's selection.
