        Your app runs inside Horizon as a Module Federation remote. Rather than
        asking you to match our look, the host hands your app the very
        components it renders itself. Build from these and your feature is
        indistinguishable from a native page — in every tenant&rsquo;s branding,
        in both colour modes, on day one.

        One hook, one destructure, one guard. The guard matters: your app may be
        mounted by a host that predates a component, so treat every one as
        optional and render a fallback rather than crashing the page.

        💡 The one rule worth memorising: pass colours as palette paths
        (&lsquo;text.secondary&rsquo;, &lsquo;primary.main&rsquo;,
        &lsquo;divider&rsquo;), never as hex and never read out of a theme
        object you captured earlier. A captured token is a snapshot of whichever
        mode was active when your app loaded, and it stops following the toggle.
