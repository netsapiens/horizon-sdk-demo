/**
 * Component Showcase — the visual reference for everything the host hands over
 * on `horizonContext.ui`, and the page a partner developer is pointed at first.
 *
 * Each component has its own self-contained section under `showcase/sections/`
 * (live demo + copy-paste snippet + a note on where the host itself uses it);
 * this file is only the running order. The sections are grouped rather than
 * listed flat, because the page is long enough that a reader needs to know
 * whether they are still in "things you type into" or have reached "things that
 * draw data" — and because the groups are the shape of the kit itself.
 *
 * Every section renders nothing when its components are missing, so an older
 * host that predates a component simply shows a shorter page instead of a
 * broken one. That is the same guard partner code should use, demonstrated at
 * page scale.
 *
 * The header's Hide code action collapses every snippet at once. Roughly half
 * this page by height is source, which is what a developer came for and pure
 * noise to anyone scanning for a control — so the page is really two documents
 * and the toggle picks which one you are reading. It is also the shortest
 * honest demonstration of a `PageAction` descriptor: a label, an icon and an
 * onClick, rendered by the host in the same style as every other page's header
 * button.
