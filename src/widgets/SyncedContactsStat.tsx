/**
 * Contacts synced — a `kind: 'leaf'` widget with `leafOf: 'demo-insight'`.
 *
 * Registered in `App.tsx` §4. The body is `ui.StatBlock` — the same block the
 * native stat leaves draw — so this cell and *Active Calls* two panels over are
 * the same component with different numbers. It used to hand-build a value, a
 * caption and a row of `Box` bars, which is how an app's leaf ended up sitting
 * beside a native one looking like a different kind of thing.
 *
 * The leaf contract is unchanged and still worth knowing: no `size` (its
 * container's grid owns the width) and `widget.pixel` is `{ width: 0, height: 0 }`,
 * so nothing here reads a box. The only difference from `RecordedCallsStat` is
 * where it lands — that one declares `leafOf: 'stat'` and drops into the host's
 * own stat card; this one names the category the demo's container accepts.
