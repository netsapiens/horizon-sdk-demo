/**
 * Recordings processed — a `kind: 'leaf'` widget with `leafOf: 'stat'`.
 *
 * Registered in `App.tsx` §4. It sits **inside** the host's own stat container,
 * directly beside native blocks like Active Calls, which is exactly why it may
 * not draw itself: this file used to hand-build the number as
 * `Typography variant='h4' fontWeight={600}`, and the native block next to it is
 * `h4`'s own weight at `text.secondary`. Sampled side by side that is 700 vs 600
 * and `rgb(77,89,94)` vs `rgb(27,33,36)` — invisible until someone inspects it,
 * and then obviously wrong.
 *
 * So it renders `ui.StatBlock`, which mirrors the native block element for
 * element. The lesson generalises: a widget that lands among host components
 * should be composed of host components, and any styling it does itself is a
 * copy that will drift.
 *
 * The numbers come from the same `SAMPLE_CALL_RECORDINGS` fixture the Call
 * Recordings page lists, so the dashboard stat and the page agree — which is
 * what a real widget-plus-page pairing looks like.
