/**
 * Sync failures — the second `leafOf: 'demo-insight'` leaf.
 *
 * Registered in `App.tsx` §4. A container with one leaf shows that leaves land
 * in it; a container with two shows the rest of the contract — they reorder
 * within that card and nowhere else, and removing one leaves the container on
 * the grid rather than deleting it.
 *
 * Drawn with `ui.StatBlock` like its neighbour, and reading the same
 * `mocks/syncQueue.ts` fixture the sync queue pages through, so the failing rows
 * in that panel and the count here always agree. Two surfaces disagreeing about
 * one number is the thing a dashboard is least forgiven for.
