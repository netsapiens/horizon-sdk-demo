/**
 * Sync outcomes — the demo's `ui.Donut` example.
 *
 * Lives only on the Example CRM page (`pages/VendorDashboardPage.tsx`), not in
 * the host's widget catalogue, and that is worth noticing on its own: a card
 * built with `templates.DashboardTemplate` is page content, so it needs no
 * registration, no zone and no id anybody has to keep stable. An app can add one
 * without touching what it contributes to the platform.
 *
 * The donut is its own kit component rather than a mode of `ui.Chart` because it
 * takes no axes and the host lays its legend out differently — the same split
 * the native usage-breakdown panels make. Slice colour comes from a semantic
 * `tone`, so the ring follows the light/dark toggle with nothing here to update.
 *
 * It reads the same `mocks/syncQueue.ts` fixture the sync queue table pages
 * through, so the two cards on this page always agree about how many rows are
 * failing.
