/**
 * "CRM Status (SDK)" — a dynamic column merged into the host's domain Contacts
 * grid, showing whether the demo's CRM has reconciled each contact.
 *
 * This replaces a "Priority" column that used to sit on Call Logs, and the
 * reasons it was removed are the design brief for this one:
 *
 *   - **It was on the wrong page.** Call Logs is one of the busiest tables in
 *     the platform. A column an app invented, on a page everyone reads daily,
 *     gets treated as platform data.
 *   - **It was misleading.** "Priority" was derived from call duration and
 *     direction by this app's own rule, but nothing on screen said so, so it
 *     read as a rating the platform had assigned.
 *
 * Hence the label. `(SDK)` is a caveat in the header itself, where a reader
 * meets it before the value — a column that cannot be mistaken for native is
 * the honest shape for an app-owned column, and it costs one word.
 *
 * The state comes from the same fixture the CRM Sync page and the sync-queue
 * widget read, so the three surfaces agree about any given contact. That is the
 * point worth making to a partner: a dynamic column is not a decoration bolted
 * onto someone else's grid, it is your app's data, in the place the user is
 * already looking.
 *
 * Also the reference for the second argument the host hands `renderCell`: the
 * same `ExtensionContext` zone extensions get. Rendering from `context.ui` is
 * what makes the cell follow the host's light/dark toggle — the hardcoded-hex
 * version this pattern replaced looked identical in both schemes.
