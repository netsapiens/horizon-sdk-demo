/**
 * Card declarations for the Example CRM page (`pages/VendorDashboardPage.tsx`).

 * Kept out of the page for the same reason `demoContent.ts` is: a page file is
 * layout, and everything here is copy plus the layout facts the host needs —
 * title, subtitle, span, reserved height, which cards follow the shared range,
 * and where a number came from. The page pairs each entry with its component by
 * id and passes the list straight to `templates.DashboardTemplate`.
 *
 * Everything in this file is a DECLARATION. There is not a colour, a font size
 * or a padding value anywhere in it, because none of those are an app's to
 * choose — the host draws the card from exactly these fields.

  // These same two components register on the host's dashboard as `kind: 'leaf'`
  // (App.tsx §4), where the host puts them in a container and draws each one's
  // frame. Declaring them here as `leaves` gets exactly that — the same leaf
  // frame, the same grid breaks, the same square corners — so the pair looks
  // identical whether a reader meets it here or on the host's own dashboard.
  //
  // Declared as two separate cards, which is what this page did before the
  // template understood leaves, they came out as two panels: right numbers,
  // wrong shape, and visibly not the thing the host renders.
  //
  // A leaf only exists inside a card. There is no standalone leaf, deliberately
  // — outside a container it would just be a card with fewer features, which is
  // what `component` already gives you.
